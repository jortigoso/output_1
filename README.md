## Components

Full list of components needed are included in the output.csv file. 

- Potentiometers need to be stereo (double). 
- Jack sockets are PJ301M-120 (3.5mm) and PJ-341 (6.3mm). 
- Parallel feedback capacitors are not needed but recommended.
- 2 LM386 auido amplifiers 

In order to save space and to reduce costs (since double alpha potentiometers are expensive), the pots are connected via wirees to the PCB.
